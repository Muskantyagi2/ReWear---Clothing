# ReWear---Clothing
This code contains the full-stack implementation of ReWear, a web-based platform that enables users to exchange unused clothing through direct swaps or a point-based redemption system. The project promotes sustainable fashion and helps reduce textile waste by encouraging the reuse of wearable garments.
